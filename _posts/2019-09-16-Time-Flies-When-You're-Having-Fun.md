Two and a half month. Wow time flies. I have made progress on the CSV and it is nearly ready to start running tests on and having visuals made. Today i am going to post this data so we can all see the progress that has been made. I have less time for my own personal project than i would like with teaching and with being a student myself however i am still making progess and i hope to be able to post the first set of tests and possibly visuals the next time i post in two weeks time. Here hoping! -Link to the CSV - https://github.com/Ravenha/Project-1/blob/master/Transdeaths_2.csv
