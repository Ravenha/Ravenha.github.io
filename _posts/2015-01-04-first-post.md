About 3 weeks ago i made the decision to study Data Science and on Monday July 8th of 2019 I took the first steps into a very wide world of information and machine learning. My first few days have been terrifyingly exhilarating as I reach the AHA! moments and run in more errors than I care to admit to. I look forward to continuing my journey making my mistakes and learning much much more. Who knows maybe someday you will be reading articles and projects I had a major hand in creating.
