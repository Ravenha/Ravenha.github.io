In three days it will officially be one month since starting on this new path. Quite a lot has changed in this time and it has already had plenty of ups and downs. in my first Unit or Sprint I breezed through it. It was easy to follow easy to master and easy to implement. The second Unit my most recent one was much more intense. I struggled quite a bit with this one but I persevered and in the end i feel i have mastered it. Along with these changes in school came a few new realizations in my own personal life, of which I won't go into detail here but if you are curious, feel free to stop by my personal sites like Facebook or Twitter! Now onto week 5 I feel both trepidation and excitement to get started. Until next time!
