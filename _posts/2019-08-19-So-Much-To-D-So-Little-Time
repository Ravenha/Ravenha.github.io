Here we are. A month and a half into my schooling and ive started my own project. So far my grades are great. nothing to write home about yet but im learning quickly. After much though and quite a bit of consideration i decided to make my own dataset. This means i will need to teach myself how to scrape websites and compile all this data together in my free time. The subject i chose is one i cannot seem to find any previous data sets made on. I chose to find the corrilation of Trans deaths and how each region of the world compares to one another. Lots of work ahead but i will keep this updated as i make progress.
