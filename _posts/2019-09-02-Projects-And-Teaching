Two months in and ive made astounding progress. Ive taught myself how to use Beautiful Soup to get the data i need and to keep things updated. I have scraped the websites and cleaned this up a bit and got my first CSV of the data. Its incomplete and not entirely cleaned yet but it is good progress! On a side note I am now a Section Lead and a Team Lead for the newest students to Data Science. Meaning as a Team Lead i help facilitate the learning process and make sure my students are doing well. As a Section Lead it is my job to oversee the other Team Leads in my cohort and ensure they are succeeding in their new roles. This is exciting and a great opportunity to lead and to learn.
