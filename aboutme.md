Hi! I'm Bethany. Beth for short. I love learning and I have a hunger for knowledge.
Right now im studying at Lambda School for Data Science and I am also a Section Lead and a Team Lead with Lambda when im not building, repairing, or maintaining computers and other systems. I am self made and very driven to obtain my goals whatever they may be. I am activly involved with the LGBT community and use my resources and free time to help bring light to the growing issues therein. I am excited to start my career in Data Science and starting the next chapter of my life!
